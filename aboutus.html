     <p class="text-justify">
    Lord VISHWAKARMA is considered by followers of the Hindu faith to be the divine architect or engineer of the universe. Drawing inspiration from Lord Viswakarma, his descendants are renowned for their outstanding architectural skills. The ancient temples of Sri Kalahasthi, Tirupathi, Srisailam, Lepakshi, Amaravathi, 1000 pillars, Alampur, Arasavilli, Bhadrachalam and Ramappa in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh bear ample testimony to the precision, skills and aesthetic craftsmanship of the Vishwabrahmins.<br />
<br />
 In modern times, the Vishwabrahmins have diversified their occupations from the building trade to embrace newer professions like medicine, engineering, law, management, governance, arts and education, among others, in tune with the trends of the present day. However, although the Vishwabrahmins have been making a substantial contribution to the social, cultural and economic fields through the ages, recognition for their contribution to the well-being of the Telugu speaking people is inadequately acknowledged.
<br />
<br />
There is therefore, a collective effort that is needed to rejuvenate the   Viswakarma community with planned and programmed interventions, a responsibility that the Vishwakarma Foundation and Seva Trust, founded by eminent members of the Vishwabrahmin community, has been shouldering since in 2014. Since then, every year new activities are added to serve community members optimally and improve, after a detailed consultative process.
